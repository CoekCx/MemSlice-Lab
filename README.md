# MemSlice Lab

MemSlice Lab is an interactive web application designed to help students and developers understand memory layouts, endianness, and pointer arithmetic in C/C++ programming. The application provides a visual representation of memory cells and allows users to experiment with different memory configurations.

## Features

### 1. Memory Visualization
- Interactive memory cell display with hexadecimal values
- Real-time updates and value editing
- Visual comparison between user input and expected solutions
- Support for both Little Endian and Big Endian representations

### 2. Code Integration
- Built-in C/C++ code editor with syntax highlighting
- Predefined examples demonstrating various memory concepts:
  - Struct layouts
  - Pointer arithmetic
  - Array representations
  - Multi-level pointers
  - Nested structures

### 3. Exercise Mode
- Practice mode for testing understanding
- Solution comparison feature
- Instant feedback on correct/incorrect values
